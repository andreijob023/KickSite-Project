      <h3>What is Karate?</h3>
        <p class="info">Karate is a <b>Japanese martial art</b> whose physical aspects seek the development of defensive and counterattacking body movements.  The themes of traditional karate training are fighting and self-defense, though its mental and moral aspects target the overall improvement of the individual.  This is facilitated by the discipline and persistent effort required in training.   If karate had to be described in only one sentence, then the most suitable one may arguably be "You never attack first in karate."<br><br>
        Is a discipline that is focused on self-improvement, physical and mental well-being, and sportsmanship. While the sport is known for its physical demands, it also has rules of conduct that every practitioner must follow. These rules of conduct are not only important for ensuring a fair and safe match but also help the practitioner to develop a sense of respect, humility, and control. In this step-by-step guide, we will discuss how to follow the karate rules of conduct effectively.</p>

      <h3>Karate Rules and Policies</h3>
      <p class="info">Karate, like many other martial arts, has a set of rules that govern both the physical and mental aspects of training. Often called the „code of ethics“ or „code of conduct,“ these rules aim to promote discipline, respect, and self-control. In this blog post, we’ll explore the key karate rules of conduct, their significance, and how to apply them to your training.</p>
      <h3 class="basic">Karate's basic rules</h3>
      <p class="info">The first step in following the karate rules of conduct is to learn the basic rules of karate. These rules are typically outlined in the karate handbook or taught by instructors during the training sessions. Some of the basic rules include:</p>

        <li>Avoid talking, eating, or chewing gum during the training.</li>
        <li>Follow safety measures such as protective gear during sparring sessions.</li>
      </ul>
